## Session: 2025-01-13 (Horizon Worker Agent - Claude Opus 4.5)

### Accomplished
- Implemented complete SDKClient class for real Reachy Mini hardware communication
- Implemented ToolCache class with 200ms TTL for read-only operations
- Added comprehensive error handling classes (RobotConnectionError, NotAwakeError, MotorError)
- Added 26 new tests for SDKClient (ToolCache, SDKClient methods, exceptions)
- Fixed mypy type errors and ruff linting issues
- All 48 robot tests passing

### Implementation Details
- `src/reachy_agent/robot/sdk.py`: Full SDKClient implementation with:
  - Zenoh/SDK connection management with timeout
  - ToolCache for caching read-only operations (200ms TTL)
  - All ReachyClient protocol methods implemented
  - Graceful error handling when SDK is not available
  - Joint limit validation and clamping
  - Structured logging throughout
- `tests/test_robot.py`: Added tests for:
  - TestToolCache: cache init, set/get, invalidation patterns
  - TestSDKClient: init, limits, connection errors, method behaviors
  - TestSDKClientExceptions: all custom exception classes
  - TestCachedResult: dataclass TTL behavior

### Current State
- Features F001-F050 are marked as passing (50/210)
- Features F051-F210 are pending (160 remaining)
- Next feature: F051 "Implement tool result caching with 200ms TTL"
- Note: F051 may already be partially complete since ToolCache is implemented in sdk.py
  - Need to verify MCP server uses caching and add specific tests

### Next Session Should
- Verify F051 requirements against existing ToolCache implementation
- Add tests for MCP tool caching (`tests/test_mcp.py::test_tool_caching`)
- Continue with F052-F063 (Memory subsystem):
  - F052: Define MemoryType enum with 3 types
  - F053: Define Memory dataclass with metadata support
  - F054: Implement MemoryManager with ChromaDB backend
  - F055-F059: Memory store/search/forget/expiry methods
  - F060-F063: Memory MCP server tools

### Blockers
- None

### Technical Notes
- mypy configured with `ignore_missing_imports = true` in pyproject.toml
- Tests run without actual hardware using mock mode
- SDKClient gracefully handles missing reachy_mini package
- Linters (black, ruff) configured for 88-character line length
